Facebook Inc., the parent company of Facebook, has decided to change its name and company’s vision to Meta Inc. For the world’s biggest social media and communication services provider, this is only the best step going forward into the 21st century’s digital revolution. For many of its users worldwide, this news has been stunning, confusing, wondering, and quite perplexing because modernistic name such as Meta holds many virtual probabilities in the future.

But what Facebook’s decision-makers were still unable to clarify is how it would impact, and resolve, the ever-plaguing issue of privacy and sanctity of PII (personally identifiable information). Over the years, Facebook has brought many great and welcoming changes to the arena of social media and online communication. It has been equally disastrous when it comes to user privacy in all those years as well. In this narrative, we will try to decipher how the all-new Meta Inc. will be able to resolve privacy issues that are inherited from its former self Facebook inc. 


## Meta Inc – The Owner of Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus & Others

Having such an impactful portfolio of products under its belt, Facebook Inc. has announced its name change in October of the last year. Many were left wondering what this novel change means to Facebook’s huge user base. The company’s co-founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said about the name change at the annual Connect Conference:
“To reflect who we are and the future we hope to build, I’m proud to share that our company is now Meta. I used to study Classics, and the word “meta” comes from the Greek word meaning “beyond.” For me, it symbolizes that there is always more to build, and there is always a next chapter to the story.”

This is indeed not a trivial coming out of the genius of Mark Zuckerberg. Meta Inc., which with all its apps also known as Metaverse, finally takes the old Facebook into the world of virtual and augmented reality. For tech-enthusiasts and Gen Z/Millennials, this was about the time when the combination of virtual/augmented realities should be employed in communication. 

However, the revolutionary change doesn’t even bother to address the reputational-damaging issues about data/privacy security for which Facebook has been constantly thrashed worldwide. People are now more alert as to how their data will be processed and utilized when combined with VR/AR, with a possible mingling of AI (Artificial Intelligence) to manage things up. So, how Mark Zuckerberg intends to resolve the privacy concerns regarding his company, and what issues will Meta has to consider before obtaining the trust of their users and making it easier for Meta to legibly become a Metaverse of loyalist users? Let’s find out!

## The First & The Foremost: Data and Privacy Security from Day One

Mr. Zuckerberg was aware of the fact about how his company enjoys a tarnished image when it comes to user privacy and data security. That is why there are no “ifs” and “buts” about closing the complete lid on user data and privacy – no exceptions! If Metaverse is intended to make it big in the future, this must be the first and foremost concern that Zuckerberg and co need to resolve concretely – no puns or false promises intended!

To this end, Mr. Zuckerberg mentioned in his initial announcement about Meta that privacy and safety will be the first pillar on which Meta will stand and expand. How will it be ensured? Well, people using Meta’s products will have full control over their profiles and features – the data that is. The users will also be able to decide fully when to teleport between Meta’s virtual and personal environment, what data needs to be shared and whatnot, with full user consent. 

## Unparalleled Transparency Will Be the Key

Of course, some form of data will be mandatory to share with Meta to use its products. That is another space in which Meta Inc. must have to provide concrete transparency, even for the 1 byte of data that is shared with the company in exchange for a feature or service. The Meta’s former-self Facebook was also a constant target for activists and lawmakers about the company’s cruel concealing of user data sharing, often in the form of ad tracking or hidden cookies on the user’s device. But with the new Meta Inc., Mark and his team must have to go completely transparent with what data they collect and how Meta will be using this data – even the compulsory ones. 

The icing on the cake would be if Meta introduces an on/off sharing switch at the user’s discretion, even for basic data sharing. Although this seems an ideal situation to effectively curb the data transparency issue in the new Metaverse, it however seems too good to be implemented. In the ever-growing digital age, Meta users will be able to fully immerse into their virtual environment which will show such minute details as their true identities; eye movements, skin tone, expressions, and even the virtual model of their psychical abode. 

This is too dangerous a detail for a tech company of Facebook’s repute. Third-party services providers and partners with Meta Inc., not to mention other unethical intruders, may have plenty of buffets to satisfy their appetites. To this end, and quite unfortunately, the revolutionary change in Facebook has no concrete plan as of now to address this issue. This is will be a huge blockade to Metaverse’s success in the future. However, Facebook has said that they will place stringent methods to secure people's avatars in their Metaverse. But of course, it’s all-seeing first until believing because that’s where Facebook has never enjoyed a credible reputation. One can only hope that soon Meta may come up with something authentic for privacy and data security.

## Finally, Why the New ‘Marvellian’ Change?

As of now, nothing more than venturing into the limitless possibilities offered by the emerging technologies of VR, AR, and AI. According to research put forth by <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/augmented-and-virtual-reality-market" target="_blank">Allied Market Research</a>, both AR and VR are projected to reach almost $500 billion by 2030 globally. Another study conducted by Zyro estimates that by 2025, AI is expected to surpass the $190 billion mark with global spending of almost $57 billion on AI systems. 

Of course, a company of Meta’s stature wouldn’t even give a second thought about not entering and cutting themselves a piece of this fresh cream cake. However, the future success and longevity of Meta importantly depend on how it resolves the underlying privacy issues, and more in this regard, soon. So, our advice to all wondering, confused, motivated, or perplexed users is to keep your fingers crossed, hope for the best, but always stay vigilant for any kind of side-stepping on Meta’s behalf.
