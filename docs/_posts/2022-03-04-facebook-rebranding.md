Facebook Inc., the parent company of Facebook, has decided to change its name and company’s vision to Meta Inc. For the world’s biggest social media and communication services provider, this is only the best step going forward into the 21st century’s digital revolution. For many of its users worldwide, this news has been stunning, confusing, wondering, and quite perplexing because modernistic name such as Meta holds many virtual probabilities in the future. But what Facebook’s decision-makers were still unable to clarify is how it would impact, and resolve, the ever-plaguing issue of privacy and sanctity of PII (personally identifiable information). Over the years, Facebook has brought many great and welcoming changes to the arena of social media and online communication. It has been equally disastrous when it comes to user privacy in all those years as well. 
In this narrative, we will try to decipher how the all-new Meta Inc. will be able to resolve privacy issues that are inherited from its former self Facebook inc.

Having such an impactful portfolio of products under its belt, Facebook Inc. has announced its name change in October of the last year. Many were left wondering what this novel change means to Facebook’s huge user base. The company’s co-founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said about the name change at the annual Connect Conference:
“To reflect who we are and the future we hope to build, I’m proud to share that our company is now Meta. I used to study Classics, and the word “meta” comes from the Greek word meaning “beyond.” For me, it symbolizes that there is always more to build, and there is always a next chapter to the story.”
This is indeed not a trivial coming out of the genius of Mark Zuckerberg. Meta Inc., which with all its apps also known as Metaverse, finally takes the old Facebook into the world of virtual and augmented reality. For tech-enthusiasts and Gen Z/Millennials, this was about the time when the combination of virtual/augmented realities should be employed in communication. 
However, the revolutionary change doesn’t even bother to address the reputational-damaging issues about data/privacy security for which Facebook has been constantly thrashed worldwide. People are now more alert as to how their data will be processed and utilized when combined with VR/AR, with a possible mingling of AI (Artificial Intelligence) to manage things up. So, how Mark Zuckerberg intends to resolve the privacy concerns regarding his company, and what issues will Meta has to consider before obtaining the trust of their users and making it easier for Meta to legibly become a Metaverse of loyalist users? Let’s find out!
